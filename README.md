As the pro-sex community continues to be deplatformed from popular social media, many have began downloading their account data, only to be overwhelmed by a compressed JSON file. Something that is almost useless and unreadable to a non-developer. This web application solves this issue by instructing users on how to access the correct files, and transform that big, scary block of text into a clean readable list of their followers, following, and mutuals.

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. If you haven't already downloaded your IG data, go to your profile and open <b>Settings</b> and then <b>Security</b>. Under <b>Data and History</b>, click <b>Download Data</b> and follow the instructions
2. When receiving your email confirmation, follow instructions on downloading your data files to your computer
3. Unzip your files
4. Open the folder that has <b>part_1</b> at the end of its name
5. In this folder, open the file named <b>connections.json</b>
6. CMD/CTRL+A to select all, and COPY the text in this files
7. PASTE text into text area of application
8. Submit, and voila!

### CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY
